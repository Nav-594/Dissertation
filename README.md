## Abstract

Identification of linear B-cell epitopes remains an important task for diagnostic tests and developing vaccines, by providing targets for experimental investigation. The field of epitope prediction has been rapidly evolving since its inception, from unreliable single propensity scales to state-of-the-art models and machine learning models being developed. Genetic programming has not been used for epitope prediction, this dissertation aims to provide insight into the efficacy of using genetic programming in the epitope prediction problem.

This dissertation presents a novel approach to linear B-cell epitope prediction using a genetic programming classification model, which has yet to be implemented in the epitope prediction problem. Through a robust data-mining pipeline, a Lentivirus dataset was cleaned and prepared for the modelling of the genetic programming classifier. The model was tested against the current state-of-the-art epitope prediction tool, BepiPred 3.0 which is widely used as a benchmark in this field. The genetic programming model demonstrated superior performance compared to BepiPred 3.0, showcasing the viability of using evolutionary methods for epitope prediction. 

This dissertation provides valuable insight into the application of genetic programming in the epitope prediction problem and showcases the feasibility of using genetic programming in this context.
